- Background color: Light gray (#D3D3D3), very desaturated, used for the page background, creating a subtle backdrop that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Light cyan (#E0FFFF), to highlight important interactive elements and draw attention to key sections.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile, modern sans-serif, for readability and a clean aesthetic.
- Use a single-column layout for optimal mobile viewing, with a maximum width for larger screens to maintain readability.
- Employ simple, outlined icons for a clean and modern feel. The icons should support ease of navigation, rather than distracting embellishment.
- Implement subtle animations for page transitions and interactive elements to enhance user experience, without slowing down the user's experience.
